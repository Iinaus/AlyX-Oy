### Subject

A new imaginary company called ÄlyX has opened in Helsinki. The company manufactures wooden puzzle games. The company's wish is to have pages with at least the following sections:

- front page
- products (pictures of puzzle games and information about them)
- resale (the page tells about the possibility of getting products for sale, the page has a contact form)
- Contact information (ÄlyX Oy, Pulmatie 100, 00101 Helsinki, tel. 555 123 4567, email: konttori@alyx.fi)

You can come up with the more detailed content of the page yourself and, if necessary, use "lorem ipsum" for longer texts.
